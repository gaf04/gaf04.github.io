    <h1>001: Text on a screen</h1>

    <p>That&rsquo;s all this is: text on an electronic screen. A
      sequence of legible ASCII characters encoded as UTF-8. Any
      formatting I must endure can be easily introduced with one of the
      dozens of Markdown varieties, but even un-processed it remains
      text.

    <p>Why do we preoccupy ourselves so much with
      &ldquo;interactive&rdquo; content, with JavaScript frameworks,
      with all of these short-lived solutions to non-existant problems.
      Why is it that so many people who wish nothing more than to put
      text on a screen first undertake the thankless, worthless task of
      glueing together a mountain of cruft?

    <p>This concluded, they congradulate themselves on their
      ingenuity, announce to the world that &ldquo;webdev is
      hard&rdquo;, laugh (and perhaps weep) and go on to use these
      overengineered, overdesigned systems. They have attempted to cook
      scrambled eggs with a military flamethrower, and who can blame
      them? That&rsquo;s simply <em>how it&rsquo;s done</em>.
