# Servants

The odorous taste of incense hangs heavy around me, flooding my nostrils
and caking my tongue with sour trepidation.  The Angels' divine idols
stand in a half-circle behind the altar, stained with all manner of
bodily substances.

"They can serve us yet, Lords," I say, and the lie poisons my tongue.
"We can always use more waste for the kitchens, prey for the arenas,
waste for the bio-fabricators---"

_Silence, whelpling,_ say the Angels, and I prostrate myself before
the idols.

_The Unworthy are not some mere irritant;  they are a pestilence,
a disease, a blasphemous plague against all that is holy._

Behind the deafening voices I can hear the maddening drip, drip, drip
as puddles form before the idols:  black, steaming, bubbling, hissing,
roiling, _laughing_ as they dribble across the gleaming marble and burn
my bare feet.

_They are **ROT** and **CORRUPTION**_, scream the Angels through melting
mouths, _they are cancer and filth and perverted deviance..._

## INTROSPECTION

Something with memories, perhaps?  I'm not quite sure yet.

My head aches;  the words begin to blur together into a cacophony of
painful noise, each syllable twisting in my bleeding eardrums like
a knife.

## CONCLUSION

I definitely want to do something with a bomb here.
