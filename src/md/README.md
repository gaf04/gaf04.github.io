In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text
commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface
without relying on meaningful content.  Lorem ipsum may be used before
final copy is available, but it may also be used to temporarily replace
copy in a process called greeking, which allows designers to consider
form without the meaning of the text influencing the design.

Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et
malorum, a first-century BC text by the Roman statesman and philosopher
Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical,
improper Latin.

Versions of the Lorem ipsum text have been used in typesetting at least
since the 1960s, when it was popularized by advertisements for Letraset
transfer sheets.  Lorem ipsum was introduced to the digital world in
the mid-1980s when Aldus employed it in graphic and word-processing
templates for its desktop publishing program PageMaker.  Other popular
word processors including Pages and Microsoft Word have since adopted
Lorem ipsum as well.

Eigengrau (German for "intrinsic gray", lit. 'own gray'; pronounced [ˈʔaɪ̯gn̩ˌgʁaʊ̯]), also called Eigenlicht (Dutch and German for "own light"), dark light, or brain gray, is the uniform dark gray background that many people report seeing in the absence of light. The term Eigenlicht dates back to the nineteenth century,[1] but has rarely been used in recent scientific publications. Common scientific terms for the phenomenon include "visual noise" or "background adaptation". These terms arise due to the perception of an ever-changing field of tiny black and white dots seen in the phenomenon.[2]

Eigengrau is perceived as lighter than a black object in normal lighting conditions, because contrast is more important to the visual system than absolute brightness.[3] For example, the night sky looks darker than Eigengrau because of the contrast provided by the stars.
