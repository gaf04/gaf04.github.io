# 001: Text on a screen

That's all this is:  text on an electronic screen.  A sequence of legible
ASCII characters encoded as UTF-8.  Any formatting I must endure can be
easily introduced with one of the dozens of Markdown varieties, but even
un-processed it remains text.

Why do we preoccupy ourselves so much with "interactive" content,
with JavaScript frameworks, with all of these short-lived solutions to
non-existant problems.  Why is it that so many people who wish nothing
more than to put text on a screen first undertake the thankless, worthless
task of glueing together a mountain of cruft?

This concluded, they congradulate themselves on their ingenuity, announce
to the world that "webdev is hard", laugh (and perhaps weep) and go on to
use these overengineered, overdesigned systems.  They have attempted to
cook scrambled eggs with a military flamethrower, and who can blame them?
That's simply _how it's done_.
