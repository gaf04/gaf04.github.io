        <p>In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a
          placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form
          of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful
          content. Lorem ipsum may be used before final copy is
          available, but it may also be used to temporarily replace
          copy in a process called greeking, which allows designers to
          consider form without the meaning of the text influencing the
          design.

        <p>Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus
          bonorum et malorum, a first-century BC text by the Roman
          statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added,
          and removed to make it nonsensical, improper Latin.

        <p>Versions of the Lorem ipsum text have been used in
          typesetting at least since the 1960s, when it was popularized
          by advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets. Lorem ipsum
          was introduced to the digital world in the mid-1980s when
          Aldus employed it in graphic and word-processing templates
          for its desktop publishing program PageMaker. Other popular
          word processors including Pages and Microsoft Word have since
          adopted Lorem ipsum as well.

        <p>Eigengrau (German for “intrinsic gray”, lit. ‘own gray’;
          pronounced [ˈʔaɪ̯gn̩ˌgʁaʊ̯]), also called Eigenlicht (Dutch
          and German for “own light”), dark light, or brain gray, is
          the uniform dark gray background that many people report
          seeing in the absence of light. The term Eigenlicht dates
          back to the nineteenth century,[1] but has rarely been used
          in recent scientific publications. Common scientific terms
          for the phenomenon include “visual noise” or “background
          adaptation”. These terms arise due to the perception of an
          ever-changing field of tiny black and white dots seen in the
          phenomenon.[2]

        <p>Eigengrau is perceived as lighter than a black object in
          normal lighting conditions, because contrast is more
          important to the visual system than absolute brightness.[3]
          For example, the night sky looks darker than Eigengrau
          because of the contrast provided by the stars.
