        <p>In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a
          placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form
          of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful
          content. Lorem ipsum may be used before final copy is
          available, but it may also be used to temporarily replace
          copy in a process called greeking, which allows designers to
          consider form without the meaning of the text influencing the
          design.

        <p>Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus
          bonorum et malorum, a first-century BC text by the Roman
          statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added,
          and removed to make it nonsensical, improper Latin.

        <p>Versions of the Lorem ipsum text have been used in
          typesetting at least since the 1960s, when it was popularized
          by advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets. Lorem ipsum
          was introduced to the digital world in the mid-1980s when
          Aldus employed it in graphic and word-processing templates
          for its desktop publishing program PageMaker. Other popular
          word processors including Pages and Microsoft Word have since
          adopted Lorem ipsum as well.
